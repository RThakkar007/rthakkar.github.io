06]  Managing the Test Activities v4

7] Corrective actions taken do not have to be testing related.

For example, test control could suggest the scoping of functionality such as removing some less important planned deliverables from the initial delivered solution reduces the time and effort required to achieve that solution.

Delaying release into the production environment until exit criteria have been met.

We'll talk about test progress reports in a future video.

Test Completion.

Test completion collects data from completed test activities to consolidate experience, testware, and any other relevant information.
Test completion activities take place at various points throughout a project, such as to the end of a test level, an Agile iteration, the end of a test project, the release of a software system, the end of maintenance releaseeven after a project is canceled.

*Product risks* are associated with specific quality characteristics of a product; for example, functional suitability, reliability, performance efficiency, usability, security, comfortability, maintainability and portability.

in some circumstances a loop control structure may be coded incorrectly; 
response times may be inadequate for a high performance transaction processing system; 
user experience, UX, feedback might not meet product expectations.

Product risks, when they occur, may result in various negative consequences, including user dissatisfaction; loss of revenue, trust, and reputation; damage to third parties; high maintenance costs, overload of the help desk; criminal penalties; in extreme cases, physical damage, injuries, or even death.

high maintenance costs, overload of the help desk; criminal penalties; in extreme cases, physical damage, injuries, or even death

Examples of product risks include:
the software might not perform its intended functions according to the specification; the software might not perform its intended functions according to user, customer, and/or stakeholders' needs; missing or wrong functionality; runtime errors; inefficient algorithms; 
Source code documentation, such as comments, design specifications, and coding standards, is typically examined using static testing techniques like reviews or static analysis.

preventing defects in design or coding by uncovering omissions, inaccuracies, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and redundancies in requirements.

Identifying the Defects is the purpose of Static and Dynamic Testing
preventing defects in design or coding by uncovering omissions, inaccuracies, inconsistencies, ambiguities, and redundancies in requirements.

White-box testing involves examining the internal logic and structure of the software, which enables testers to identify areas of the code that have not been exercised by existing test cases. This allows for the generation of additional test cases to increase code coverage and ensure a more thorough evaluation of the software.
The given/when/then format is a structured way to document acceptance criteria, providing clear conditions (given), actions (when), and expected outcomes (then), which aids in understanding and testing user story behavior.

This test case directly relates to the user story by verifying the ability of the customer to add products to the cart, aligning with the principles of acceptance test-driven development (ATDD).
This was discussed in Lecture 88: Acceptance Test-driven Development (ATDD)

Maintaining traceability between user stories and acceptance criteria allows testers to ensure that all requirements are adequately covered by test cases. This, in turn, helps in prioritizing test execution based on the criticality of the features defined in user stories.
"A measure of test coverage criteria is the percentage of faults found." is the correct answer. Again, we were looking for the false answer. Test coverage in general means how much our test cases covered the actual content of the software. so we can test our coverage to the code or requirements and it can be used as an exit criteria.

Test cases should contain specified values and not generic, so option "Test the three types of item to post and three different weights" is not a test case. Also the requirements didn't mention "destination" as an input so any test case that contains destination is a redundant test case. Which leaves us with the only correct test case "Test 1: letter, 10 grams, postage=0.25. Test 2: book, 500 grams, postage=1.00. Test 3: package, 999 gram, postage =2.53"


**PROJECT RISKS:**
Project risks may have an impact on the project schedule, budget, or scope, which affects the project's ability to achieve its objectives.

EXAMPLE OF PROJECT RISK: 
Example of project risks include organizational issues:

delay may occur in delivery, task completion, or satisfaction of exit criteria or definition of done; inaccurate estimates; reallocation of funds to higher priority projects, or general cost cutting across the organization may result in inadequate funding;
late changes may result in substantial rework. 

People issues: skills, training, and staff may not be sufficient;
personnel issues may cause conflict and problems; users, business staff, or subject matter experts may not be available due to conflicting business priorities.

Technical issues: scope creep, which is uncontrolled changes to the project's requirements; poor tool support; requirements may not be defined well enough;

the requirements may not be met given existing constraints; the test environment may not be ready on time; data conversion, migration planning, and their tool support may be late; weaknesses in the development process may impact
the consistency or quality of project work products such as design, code, configuration, test data, and test cases; poor defect management and similar problems may result in accumulated defects and other technical debt.

Supplier issues:
a third party may fail to deliver a necessary product or service, or go bankrupt;
contractual issues may cause problems to the project; project risks may affect both development activities and test activities.
In some cases, project managers are responsible for handling all project risks,
but it's not unusual for test managers to have the responsibility for test-related project risks.

Learning from one's own mistakes makes it possible to improve the process that organizations are using to develop and test software.

One of th mst famous improvement techniques is The Deming improvement cycle: Plan, Do, Check, Act, or PDCA .

PDCA is an iterative four-step management method used in business for the control and continual improvement of processes and products.

Plan
Define the problem to be addressed, collect relevant data, and ascertain the problem's root cause.

Do
Develop and implement a solution; decide upon a measurement to measure its effectiveness.
Check
Confirm the results through before-and-after data comparison.

Act
Document the results, inform others about process changes, and make

Improving the Testing Process with CTP(Contect-sensitive approach)

- Identification of specific challenges
- Recognition of attributes of good process
- 

Technical Skills Assessment(Hard Skills)
- Examples of Skills that should be assessed include:
• Technical skills (hard skills) and interpersonal skills (soft skills)
• Technical skills (hard skills) can be demonstrated by:
 Deriving test cases from a requirements document
 Reviewing technical documentation (requirements, code, etc.) : can they find faults in a requirement document
• Writing review comments in a clear, understandable and objective way
• Applying various testing techniques appropriately to given scenarios


**If you are applying to be a test manager:**
• can you Interview a co-worker
• How about giving criticism or compliment a developer
• Do you have negotiation skills?
• Do you have motivation skills?
• Do you have influencing skills?
• How about conflict resolution skills: can the test manager
know the correct media to use for the necessary communication and must be able to focus on building and maintaining relationships within the organization even under the worst situwation.

While this is not a complete list and the specific desired skills will vary between environments and organizations, it is a list of skills that are commonly needed.

Such assessment will help you the test manager to assess the areas of strength and weakness of newly hires as well as your current team.

Which in return will help you to determine areas for growth and training.
